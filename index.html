<body>
...In the year 1974, Porsche produced a total of 109 Carrera 3.0. From the total number of units produced, only 54 cars were built to 'RS' specification while the remaining 55 where finished as 'RSR' race cars. 
<br>
<br>
The Carrera RS 3.0 is probably the ultimate dual purpose road/racing car. Amongst the rarest of all the 911 derivatives, it was built to replace the ultra-successful 2.7 RS and 2.8 RSR from the previous year of which 1580 cars had been built. Because the new 3.0 RS was judged to be an evolution of the 2.7 RS, the FIA regulated that only a minimum of 100 examples of the new car needed to be built for homologation in either the Group 3 or Group 4 racing classes. A total of 109 Carrera RS 3.0 models were built for 1974 and of those, 52 were RS models to Group 3 spec with the remaining 55 examples built to RSR Group 4 spec. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 2.8 RSR with the brake system from the 917 and was effectively an evolution of the Penske built RS 3.0 cars built for the â€™74 IROC series. The use of thinner metal panels and a spartan interior enabled the weight of the new 3.0 RS to be reduced to somewhere around 900 kg(1984 lbs.). 
<br>
<br>
The chassis numbers started with
911 460 9017 through 911 460 9121 (911 460 9001-9109, per 911Specs.com)
