<b>911 460 9018</b> > 1974 Porsche 911 Carrera RS 3.0 > We have the pleasure to offer this exceptional Porsche 911 Carrera RS(G) 3.0 for sale on behalf of its current owner.
As evidenced by its impressive 10+ year race history under the Max Moritz banner, this particular car is also known as "The Max Moritz RS".
Introduced in 1974, the Carrera RS 3.0 is probably the ultimate dual purpose road/racing car. Amongst the rarest of all the 911 derivatives, it was built to replace the ultra-successful 2.7 RS and 2.8 RSR from the previous year of which 1580 cars had been built. Because the new 3.0 RS was judged to be an evolution of the 2.7 RS, the FIA regulated that only a minimum of 100 examples of the new car needed to be built for homologation in either the Group 3 or Group 4 racing classes. A total of 109 Carrera RS 3.0 models were built for 1974 and of those, 52 were RS models to Group 3 spec with the remaining 55 examples built to RSR Group 4 spec. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 2.8 RSR with the brake system from the 917 and was effectively an evolution of the Penske built RS 3.0 cars built for the ’74 IROC series. The use of thinner metal panels and a spartan interior enabled the weight of the new 3.0 RS to be reduced to somewhere around 900 kg.<br>
This particular car, chassis “9018” was the first of the 52 cars completed to Group 3 spec by Porsche in mid-December ’73 and delivered new in January ’74 to its first customer, Claus Utz of Leitzenger, Germany. Entered under the “Sixtant Racing Team” banner and prepared by legendary car builder Max Moritz, Utz and fellow German amateur racers Hortz Gödel and Jean-Claude Berlin raced the RSG in German DRM and DARM national championship events with Gödel winning at Mainz-Finthen. This was the first of at least 29 outright wins that “9018” would achieve over the next six years. As well as the German national championship races, “9018” also took part in the Nurburgring 1000 Kms four times and the 1975 Le Mans 24 Hours. That same year Utz won at Sembach and at Mainz-Finthen, but the following year was much more successful with Utz winning 11 races outright.<br>
At the end of 1976 the RS was sold to Jurgen Lassig who raced the car over the two years with Boss sponsorship winning six races in 1977 and nine races in 1978. With the purchase of a new 934/5 for Lassig to race in 1979, the RS lay unused and in storage at Max Moritz Racing until being sold in 1980 through Autofarm-Porsche to Don Coaster of Burton-on-Trend in England. Retained until 1989, Don sold the car to Charlie Agg who was looking for a civilised fast road car as his daily user, a job the car performed admirably until Charlie sold the car in 2001 to Nicolaus Springer who then sold #9018 to well known classic car collectors Lukas Huni and Conrad Ulrich. They owned “9018” for the next 12 years until it was sold to the current owner in 2013. During 2014 and 2015, a full no-expense spared restoration was done by Swiss Porsche expert Marc de Siebenthal and the car was also repainted in its original white livery with gold “Carrera” side lettering. The restoration was completed in October 2015 and fresh FIA HTP papers were issued for #9018. Since its restoration, the car has been used sparingly in selected historic events such as the 2017 Cento ore Modena rally.<br>
The condition of the car is near concours and as it left the factory in 1974. Despite its impressive racing career, the car retains its original engine (type 911/77 with engine number 6840037) and 915 gearbox making it a matching numbers car ! All engine and mechanical components are correct 3.0 RS specification. The original "BOSS" Max Moritz front trunk lid and bumper come with the car as well as the original Fahrzeugbrief, Porsche Certificate and an extensive ownership race history file in both German and English.<br>
This is arguably one of the very best of the rare 911 3.0 RS cars existing. Its amazing race pedigree including a Le Mans 24hr finish make it a very collectible but also very usable car which is eligible for any historic event around the world. A car for the serious Porsche collector who only wants the best !<br>

1974 Porsche 911 Carrera 3.0 RS<br>
s/n 9114609026, engine no. 6840046<br>
Grand Prix White with Gold Scripts and Black Interior<br>
<br>
Produced in 1974, the Carrera 3.0 RS picked up where the legendary 2.7 RS left off. Rightly a legend in its own right, the 2.7 RS was essentially a homologated roadgoing race car, particularly in lightweight trim, featuring upgraded suspension, driveline, aerodynamics, and reduced weight to transform the already engaging 911 into a world-class race car. For 1974, to coincide with the introduction of the “short hood” G-series 911, the RS was significantly reworked and meaningfully improved in nearly every way. Wider wheels were fitted, along with significantly flared fender arches which presaged the upcoming and now legendary 930. A new rear spoiler was also fitted to the car, the displacement increased to 3.0 liters, and the formidable brakes from the 917 fitted as well. The result was a new RS that performed better in every way and was available for a shocking $25,000. Just 56 street trimmed Carrera 3.0 RS were sold, a particularly remarkable figure considering that approximately 1580 2.7 RS Carreras were made.
<br>
This particular car is the 26th of 56 examples built and has fascinating and well-known history from new, including period race history. It was supplied new by Sonauto in Paris, registered 2309 QL 64. Its first owner, Jean-Marie Bonnmaison, raced the car extensively from 1974 to 1977, primarily in hillclimb events. The race history is as follows:
<ul>
<li>1974:
Dakar 6 Hour Race (Two heats of 3 hours each): J. Bonnemaison; 1stOA,
2nd in French Hillclimb Championship.
<br>
<li>1975:
14 Sep: Montseny (EHC): Bonnemaison, 1st in class
<br>
<li>1976:
23 May: Montseny: Bonnemaison; 6thOA, 2nd in GT class.
29 Aug: Andorra-Botella: Bonnemaison; 1st in GT class.
<br>
<li>1977:
<li>27 Mar: Ampus: Bonnemaison; 2nd in G3 class.
<li>22 May: Montseny: Bonnemaison; 2nd in G3 class.
<li>29 May: Serra da Estrella: Bonnemaison; 1st.
<li>3 Jul: Bolzano-Mendola: Bonnemaison; 2nd in G3 class.
<li>10 Jul: Trento Bondone: Bonnemaison; 2nd in G3 class.
<li>17 Jul: Dobratsch: Bonnemaison; 2nd in G3 class.
<li>31 Jul: Andorra-Botella: Bonnemaison; 8thOA, 2nd in G3 class.
<li>7 Aug: Mont Dore: Bonnemaison; 3rd in G3 class.
<br>
<li>The car was sold in 1978 to a Dr. Jean Maltcheff and registered 1373 GF 15, and in October, it was sold to Alméras Frères in Montpelier, France, registered 9131 RP 34. They entered the car in the French National Group 4 races in 1979, and sold it in April of 1980 to "Training Club Auto" in Bayonne, registered 993 RL 64.
<br>
In May of 1982, it was sold to Garage Joffroy in Marseilles, who entered it in races driven by Lunel Chapereau /Xavier Lapeyre/P.Beidel. A Patrick Bels bought the car in June of 1986, keeping it until January of 1987 when it was purchased by Dr. Jacoby Mainz, retaining the car until July of 1989 when he sold it to Jean Verchere. From 1990 to 1996, the car was part of the Albert Obrist collection in Geneva, and the car was owned from 1996 to 2005 by Bernie Ecclestone who had the car comprehensively restored in 2004 to original street configuration. The car was imported to the United States in 2005, where it has been part of two prestigious collections.
<br>
The car is cosmetically excellent and it is clear that it was restored to high standards and used minimally since. The body is straight with great gaps, and the paintwork was done to high standards. It shows virtually no signs of wear or aging. The trim is excellent throughout, and it is worth noting that this is one of the very earliest Porsche street cars to employ black trim instead of chrome trim throughout, a feature that famously appeared on Porsche’s race cars to eliminate reflections, especially at night, and ultimately set a convention that still exists today. The bumpers and both front and rear deck lids are fiberglass. The rear deck lid has the correct small grille and metal internal frame. The car is correctly presented with European rear lamps, H4 headlamps, and 8 and 9 by 15 inch fuchs with gold centers and scripts, the definitive 3.0 RS color scheme.
<br>
The interior is also correctly presented, with lightweight specification including door panels, seats, ashtray, radio, and clock delete, and lightweight carpets. The car has a 300kph speedometer as well as a bolt in rear roll bar. The condition is excellent throughout, with very nice upholstery, superb dash and instruments, and carpets in as-new condition. The headliner is also excellent.
<br>
The engine is clean and correctly presented, being nicely detailed to standards that would allow the car to be shown with relatively little preparation. The cadmium plating is excellent throughout and it is clear that the car has seen little use since being thoroughly and correctly restored. The reinforcement plates near the shock absorber mounts are in evidence, along with correct 019 fuel injection pump and 321 injection stacks. A close inspection of the undercarriage reveals that there is a seam on the floor under the driver’s seat, suggesting the car has received a clip in the past, which is not uncommon in cars with period race history. There is no evidence in the rockers of this work, and the presentation and dynamics of the car show no evidence either. The correct RS welds on the A-posts are present.
<br>
The front compartment is done to similarly high standards and is extremely clean throughout. The structural elements are excellent and the level of cosmetic preparation is very high. The car is equipped with windscreen washer system as well as heat exchangers and defroster. The spare is date-coded July 1973.
<br>
The car is a pleasure to drive, with a similar feel to the 1973 Carrera RS but turned up a notch in terms of both power and roadholding. The steering is surprisingly light given the wide tires and track, and the wonderfully tactile and communicative steering that characterizes any Porsche RS is a defining characteristic of the driving experience of this car. The suspension is impressively compliant but provides superb body control, and the motor is willing and pulls extremely well, with particularly responsive and exciting behavior in the upper rev range. The brakes are superb, being easy to modulate and stopping the car authoritatively and without drama.
<br>
This is an outstanding opportunity to acquire an extremely rare and desirable car. One of just 56 3.0 RS built, this car is in full lightweight specification and much rarer and offers higher performance than even a 1973 M471 Carrera 2.7 RS “lightweight,” yet is essentially the same price. The driving dynamics are impressive and hugely satisfying, being a step above even the lauded 2.7 RS, and the sheer exotic appeal of this car thanks to its rarity is virtually impossible to beat in the Porsche community. This is a car that will resonate with the Porsche connoisseur. The ultimate in road-going naturally-aspirated classic Porsches, it is difficult to imagine a street-legal vintage 911 with a stronger draw than a stunningly presented Carrera RS 3.0 in white with gold trim.
