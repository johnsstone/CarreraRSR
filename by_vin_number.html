        1974 Porsche 911 RSR
VIN: 9114609048
1st place at the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1977
George Dyer's car from 1974-1977
Extensive IMSA racing history
Multiple appearances at the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring
This Porsche RSR was the second of only 37 RSRs built by Porsche in 1974, and was first sold to George Dyer Racing.
 
Painted in its distinctive blue and yellow livery, Dyer and co-driver Bob Bondurant raced 9049 in 1974 IMSA Camel GT series. Although they started late in the season they ended up achieving podium finishes at Ontario and Lime Rock.
 
In 1975, co-driving with Jacques Bienvenue, Dyer and 9048 took 2nd overall at the 12 Hours of Sebring, and 4th overall at the 24 Hours of Daytona. 9048 would continue to be very successful in the 1975 IMSA series, with high finishes at Mid-America and the Daytona 250.
 
1976 brought more fortune to 9048 as Dyer would take first at Lime Rock, and add podium finishes at Ontario, Daytona and Sears Point to his record.
 
After three seasons in IMSA, Dyer finally had his moment in 9048. At the 12 Hours of Sebring the RSR piloted by Dyer, and 1976 IMSA champion Brad Frisselle, took first place overall. An amazing achievement made all the more impressive when you consider that by this time the RSR was in its fourth season, and the turbo cars had arrived. "Winning Sebring was the biggest victory," Frisselle said. "I've always been proud of it. It was even bigger than winning the series championship. It was very special." That event was heralded by a strong 4th place finish a month earlier at the 24 Hours of Daytona, and would be followed by podium finishes at Mid-America and Lime Rock.
 
Dyer would sell the car to Steve Earle and Bob Akin in 1978. As Earle & Akin Racing Associates they would go to Daytona and Sebring with Rick Knoop, where they would take 7th and 5th, respectively. 9048 would go to be campaigned by privateers in IMSA all the way thorough 1984.
 
9048 is certainly one of the best RSRs with US racing history, with several entries at Daytona and Sebring, including an overall win. It remains as one of the best-restored 1974 3.0 RSRs with its correct and highly recognizable livery. Since its restoration the RSR has been seen at multiple Monterey Historics, and is eligible for historic racing worldwide.<br>

        The third '74 RSR 3.0 built, s/n 911 460 9049 was first sold to Michael Keyser's Toad Hall Racing Team in 1974. It would become one of the most successful and visible '74 RSRs to be raced in the US. Painted yellow with distinctive black trim, Keyser and Milt Minter raced it throughout the 1974 IMSA series, achieving several top three finishes (including 2nd at Road Atlanta, 3rd at Ontario, 3rd at Mid-Ohio, 2nd at Talladega, and a heat win at Lime Rock). It also ran at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1974, where it finished 20th overall.

In 1975, co-driving with Billy Sprowls, 9049 was 2nd overall at the Daytona 24 Hours and 13th overall at the Sebring 12 Hours. It would also continue to be very successful in the IMSA series, with high finishes at Road Atlanta, Laguna Seca, and Riverside. Subsequent owners continued to race the car successfully from 1977 to 1979 in Trans Am and IMSA races, along with additional entries at the Daytona 24 Hours and the Sebring 12 Hours.
More recently, Bruce Canepa comprehensively restored 9049 and it is ready to race or show. It is certainly one of the best RSRs with US racing history, with several entries at Daytona and Sebring. It is also among only a handful of RSRs to have completed the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It remains as one of the best-restored 1974 3.0 RSRs and has its correct, highly recognizable, and distinctive Toad Hall livery.

FotoQuelle Racing Livery
Few cars can compare to the three-liter sonic fury unleashed by a Porsche Carrera RSR. Porsche Rennsport factory cars are considered among the most desirable of the 911 series racecars. The RSR demands and delivers like no other performance vehicle, especially three liter examples. In recent years, RSRs have been restored and many extensively rebuilt due to hard track use, however RSR 911 460 9060 is one of approximately thirty nine 1974 factory assembled, original cars exhibiting exceptional provenance, reliable track performance, and unchallenged racing history. You would be hard pressed to find a more sorted, developed, and accurately represented RSR with a readiness for racing and the provenance to stand up to top tier historic scrutiny.<br>
RSR 9060 was assembled by Porsche in April 1974, together with a side-valve injected 3.0-liter, 330-hp six (engine #684 0083). The bright green racecar was delivered to Autohaus, Max Moritz, who assigned Reinhard Stenzel for driving duty, running with FotoQuelle livery and sponsorship. Moritz campaigned 9060 from 1974 through 1976 amassing multiple wins.  In June 1977, 9060 was sold to Rolf Göring, where it adopted Group 5 bodywork and a sloped nose. Göring dominated hillclimb events, taking eight overall wins, four seconds, a third, a class win, and two seconds in class - all within one year.
The following year Willi Bartels purchased 9060 and returned it to Rennsport Group 4 trim. Hillclimbing again, Bartels ran sponsorship from Warsteiner where he achieved four wins, three seconds, and a fourth. In his second year however (1979), he earned nine wins including an ADAC first at Nürburgring. By 1980, 9060 had crossed the pacific to new owners in Hong Kong, competing in Viceroy livery alongside 911 460 9073 in many events including the Grand Prix of Macau, where 9060 finished third.<br>
In 1985, Larry and Jan Grove purchased and shipped RSR 9060 to California and embarked on a restoration plan. During this time, the Groves raced 9060 while researching its history. By this time, 9060 was painted white, concealing the Foto­Quelle history. The Groves were convinced 9060 was the RSR featured on the August 1974 cover of Christophorus magazine, so they began an exhaustive research program including trips to Germany, interviews, and careful removal of white paint. Documentation (included with the sale) came in the form of letters from Porsche's Jürgen Barth, historian John Starkey, Reinhard Stenzel, Eberhard Strähle (the man who shot the Christophorus cover), and many other experts who all confirmed 9060 as the FotoQuelle RSR.<br>
During the 1989 restoration, the entire car came apart revealing almost no structural damage. It had, however, been subject to proper period racing changes. Once again, the Groves and their team studied videos and photos of other RSR 3.0s, carefully determining what was correct, what the factory originally installed, and what would be appropriate for contemporary vintage racing. Kerry Morse supplied dozens of new-old-stock RSR parts. Jim Breazeale, also recognizing the importance of this car, supplied many parts from his personal collection. In 1991, after two painstaking years of research and refinement, the restoration was complete. The Groves campaigned 9060 for 15 years, eventually choosing Jim Edwards as the next steward. Edwards had raced and maintained this astonishing 1974 Carrera RSR at competitive and aesthetic levels consistent with cars of this important historic status until selling the car to the present owner and active racer Tom Van Overbeek, Father of professional Porsche pilot Johannes Van Overbeek.<br>
In 2012, under the guidance of current owner Tom Van Overbeek, 9060 was once again completely disassembled and every major system rebuilt or renewed to a high professional level. The first order of business was safety. All eight original BBS modular wheels were fully disassembled and crack checked. Five of the wheels had cracks running completely through the webbing, so were retired, retained for originality, and all new wheels were built by BBS using original style modular construction. New seats and seatbelts were also installed.<br>
During the first major shakedown and track runs, suspension was not performing as expected. So the entire front and rear suspension was rebuilt. In late 2012 while preparing for the Monterey Historics, the bottom end of the 3.0 engine was completely rebuilt and the limited slip differential replaced. A complete overhaul of the braking system was also performed.<br>
In 2013 a major decision was made to build and install a 100+ hour motor for this car.  The original RSR 3.0 motor is a very specific and unique piece of history using rare parts. The decision to save this rare motor but still use 9060 at historic track events meant building a new engine. Using a 3.2 case and crank, the 3.4 resultant engine employs 98mm Mahle cylinders and pistons, twin plug head, and GE-80 cams, all fed by side value mechanical fuel injection. Jerry Woods Enterprises performed the work resulting in a highly refined and powerful engine. At this same time, the oil cooler and associated components were replaced and the transmission was rebuilt using shorter 3rd, 4th, and 5th gears, more suited to Laguna Seca and Sonoma Raceway. These total improvements were significant and transformed an already capable car into a highly reliable performance competitor. In 2014 further upgrades were made to the safety systems including a new "Matter" style roll cage installed by Jerry Woods Enterprises.<br>
Driving 9060, even the most experienced drivers are surprised by the performance that comes on strong in all gears. The current Jerry Woods Enterprises 3.4 liter engine has continued to perform as expected, running strong at the front of the pack most recently  at the Sonoma Historics twice, and once at Rennsport.  Of course an original 3.0 RSR engine is retained, rebuilt to original specifications and is included with the sale. Weighing just 2000 lbs, 100 mph is easily achieved in under 12 seconds. Cornering is simply legendary with predictable feedback, and immense static adhesion. 9060 has been exceptionally well-sorted by top racing professionals and tested at multiple tracks for proper suspension tuning and engine settings. In the hands of a capable driver, 9060 will continually deliver, leaving even modest drivers grinning from ear to ear exiting each corner.<br>
The visual presentation of this RSR is stunning. Beautifully presented in the original FotoQuelle livery, the contrasting colors present perfectly with razor sharp paint lines, accurately proportioned graphics and period correct sponsorship markings. The paint finish is excellent overall, proudly displaying rear intake track spatter indicating the track heritage.<br>
The factory-lightened interior is functionally elegant, delivering a purposeful feel with immediate control feedback. Factory original dash and instrumentation are cleanly displayed and properly finished. An accurate reproduction of the factory roll cage is in place using original mounts, finished with padding, safety supports and seat belt anchors as needed. A contemporary seat is in place to offer updated safety provisions, while the original seat accompanies the car. Additional mechanical and safety features have been professionally updated without compromising authenticity or intended purpose.
The engine compartment continues the stunning exterior paint scheme of blue and green accented by brilliant red injection trumpets. Paint quality in the engine and front compartment is beautifully rendered. While many racecars engine bays are all about functionality, RSR 9060 provides an unforgettable visual punch when opening the hood, revealing brutish power and visual delight. Extensive research was done to confirm all exterior livery, sponsorship markings, and exact colors. RSR 9060 currently represents the original Foto-Quelle livery as raced in its debut year.<br>
Today 9060 runs very strong with the 3.4 liter race-built motor, modern (safer) wheels, contemporary racing seat, as well as up to date fuel and fire-safety systems. The period RSR engine and wheels are included with the sale along with substantial documentation, period photos, letters and notations from interviews, and Porsche reference materials specific to RSR cars and their unique equipment.<br>
RSR 9060 represents a rare opportunity to own one of the finest original tub, verified race history Porsche Rennsport Carreras in existence today. This exceptional example is fully sorted and ready for your enjoyment. Any Carrera must be considered "special", however RSR 9060 remains one of the most thoughtfully researched and professionally commissioned racecars available today. RSR 9060 is both eligible and sought after for a wide variety of prestigious racing opportunities including Tour Auto and Le Mans Classic as well as numerous concours events worldwide.<br>

<br>
History > This 1974 3.0L Carrera RSR was ordered by Peter Gregg from Porsche's racing development group at Weissach. It was one of the last RSR Carreras ever completed by the factory. Between 1976 and 1979 this specially-built Weissach 3.0L RSR driven by Jim Busby and Dave Cowart amassed seventeen IMSA podium finishes including eight overall and class wins and the 1978 IMSA GTO Championship. Additionally, it had twenty other top-ten finishes captured at every major road racing venue and endurance event within North America.
<br>
911 560 9114 was delivered with the culmination of experience that both the Weissach racing engineers and the Brumos Racing Team had acquired over the past two and a half years since Gregg had first raced a Porsche RSR. This special Carrera is documented in Karl Ludwigsen's book, "Excellence Was Expected" and is one of the few "customer" Carreras to be so featured. In that narrative Peter Gregg describes 9114 as "definitely the lightest and best-handling Carrera we ever had".
<br>
911 560 9114 was built by the Zuffenhausen customer services department for Peter Gregg and at his request. It was constructed using special 934 pre-production components such as rear trailing suspension arms made of aluminum, extra-thin body panels (for lightness), a 934 style fuel cell, a front-mounted oil tank, plus a one-off fabricated titanium spool for the 915 transaxle. Once completed, 9114 was delivered to Peter Gregg at Brumos Racing in October of 1974.
<br>
For it's very first race, the Daytona Finale in November of 1975, Gregg had Carl Schafer, the "big block" Camaro specialist, drive the car and it finished in eleventh place.
<br>
For 1976, Peter Gregg drove the Brumos-entered BMW CSL's but hedged his team's bets by having Jim Busby drive 9114 on a bonus scheme whereby Busby was rewarded with prize money the higher he placed in the races. Busby did very well with 9114, scoring four outright victories in Camel GT events (Ontario, Sears Point, Mid-Ohio, and Laguna Seca), as well as three third and one second place overall finishes. It has been said that Peter Gregg complained that Busby was earning more money than he was that year.
<br>
At the end of 1976, Jim Busby sold 9114 to Charles Mendez, the Sebring 12-Hour race promoter. Mendez raced the car just twice, (Sebring and Road Atlanta), before selling the RSR to his friend Dave Cowart of Tampa, FL. Mendez sold the RSR because he had bought an ex-Dick Barbour Racing Porsche 934 ½ and no longer had a use for 9114.
<br>
Dave Cowart raced 9114 in IMSA events for the next two and a half years, winning the GTO class outright in 1978 and placing fourth in the GTO Championship in 1979. As he was expecting a new BMW M1 for 1980, he sold the now aging RSR to Jim Mullen who raced the Carrera at Sebring and Riverside. It failed to finish at both venues due to engine failure caused by a collapsed main oil feed line which wasn't discovered until years later when the car was dismantled. This saga is documented in the August 1990 issue of Excellence magazine. Jim Mullen replaced the Carrera with a Mazda, ultimately selling 9114 to Bill Currie of Harvard MA in 1981.
<br>
Bill Currie, partnered with Bud Lyons, directed a total restoration on the RSR. This Carrera was only been seen in public twice between the completion of its restoration in 1994 and 2001. It was first displayed at the 1994 Porsche Parade in Lake Placid, NY. Four years later it was presented with the Brumos Porsche display at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance for Porsche's 50th Anniversary celebration. At both events it was exhibited in Brumos Porsche livery bearing a number "59" placard, not the correct number "61" as it was raced by Jim Busby under Brumos/Mitcom sponsorship in 1976. Jim Busby was reunited with his RSR in July of 2001 when he piloted 9114 during the Porsche Rennsport Reuion at Limerock Park. This distinctive RSR is currently owned by Lee Giannone and is participating in vintage racing exhibitions and concours events.

<br>
Since its inception, the Porsche 911 has been modified by the factory for various forms of competition including endurance racing, rallying and sprint races. The 911 is often cited as the most successful competition car ever, and in the mid-1970s the normally aspirated Carrera RSR dominated its class in World Championship sports car racing, winning at the Targa Florio, Daytona 24 Hours, Sebring 12 Hours and Nürburgring 1,000kms. 
<br>
Based on the lightweight 911 Carrera RS announced the previous year, Porsche’s RSR GT-category racer collected overall wins in the World Sportscar Championship at Daytona and the Targa Florio in 1973, defeating 3.0-Liter prototypes from Ferrari, Matra and Mirage-Ford in the process, an outstanding achievement for a production-based motor car. Powered initially by a 2.8-Liter, 300bhp engine (later versions used a 3.0-Liter 330bhp unit) the 911 RSR ruled the GT class for which it had been designed to such an extent that the category rapidly became a Porsche benefit. 
<br>
Porsche’s policy had been to entrust defence of their GT division honors to private owners and the Carrera 2.7 had been developed for this purpose. Although the factory also entered some examples, they usually ran in the Prototype class to avoid direct competition with the Zuffenhausen company’s own customers. In similar fashion to the 2.7-Liter Carrera RS, the replacement 2.8/3.0-Liter RS and RSR models were lightened by the use of thin-gauge steel in the body/chassis unit, Spartan furnishing and some plastic components, keeping weight down to around 1,980lb (900kg). The RS was essentially the road-going version, the RSR the racer, and while 109 Carrera RS 3.0s were sold at a price new of DM64,980 each, approximately 57 of them were further modified and prepared for racing or rallying at a further cost of DM30,000. Most were completed in time for the 1974 season, although a few were built for 1975, including ‘9122’, which is the second to last RSR made.
<br>
The RSR conversion differed little from that already applied to the RS, with Delrin bushes instead of rubber providing more precise suspension control; centre-lock 917-pattern magnesium-alloy wheels; a lower nose achieved by different front suspension struts with higher stub axles; and wider front brake calipers accepting thicker pads for endurance racing.
<br>
The ‘standard’ engine had bore and stroke dimensions of 95x70.4mm, displacing 2,992cc, and with a compression ratio of 9.8:1 developed circa 230bhp at 6,200rpm. The RSR Type 911/95 engine, however, developed fully 100bhp more, some 330 overall plus 233lb/ft torque at 6,500rpm. Cylinder heads, cylinder barrels and pistons were aluminium, and the RSR also featured twin-plug ignition, polished ports, Bosch fuel injection and cam profiles matching those of the old Carrera 6 model.
<br>
A former drag racer from Laguna Beach, California, Jim Busby used chassis number ‘911 560 9122’ throughout the 1975 season with considerable success. At the end of the 1976 the car was sold to Monte Shelton, who acid-dipped the bodyshell, modified the roll cage and installed superior Schrick camshafts, bringing the horsepower output to 365bhp and reducing the weight to 2,000lbs (909kg). Shelton then sold the car to privateer competitor Robert Frostrom, of Salisbury, Mayland, who continued to race it in professional events throughout the 1978 season. Frostrom sold the Carrera onward to Bill Ferran who used it in Sports Car Club of America national level events in 1979, winning twice at Moroso from the pole position. In 1980 and 1981, wearing 935-style bodywork, the RSR again saw competition at international level when it was campaigned at the famed 12 Hours of Sebring by Ferran/Bond/Refenning, finishing 10th in class in the 1980 event. 
<br>
Re-bodied to RSR specification, ‘9122’ was next sold to Ray Stuart in Monterey, subsequently passing through the hands of Kerry Morse (1985), Louis Bernat (1986), David Mohlman (2000) and Phil Bagley before being acquired by the current vendor. The car has recently undergone a comprehensive restoration returning it to original RSR specification and since completion has enjoyed successful outings in vintage racing at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races in 2006, 2007 and 2008 among various other events. The car has approximately ten events on the chassis since restoration; zero time on a fresh valve job; approximately six hours on the engine bottom-end (rebuilt by David Loop in Monterey, California); and equal time on a rebuilt transmission. 
<br>
Other recent work includes a complete professional chassis set-up with new rear shocks/springs, front springs and new rear sway bar. New steering shaft bushings and bearings have been installed; the distributor rebuilt with a new ignition rotor; the front strut cartridges rebuilt; new steering rods and links installed; rear trailing arm (front) pivot bearings replaced; and the CV joints serviced.
<br>
The talented team at D’Motorsports of Monterey, California have serviced and race-prepared the car in a no-expense-spared fashion throughout the current ownership period, and today ‘9122’ can be described as a very well prepared and maintained RSR with excellent racing cosmetics, fit to be raced or shown. The accompanying history file contains assorted period photographs and previous-owner correspondence, sundry parts invoices and restoration photographs, while included in the sale is a extensive spares package. For a complete listing, interested parties should contact the Bonhams office for further assistance. Offered on a Bill of Sale.

It has extensive European racing history and many podium finishes (see history below) including first place finishes at Diepholz and Hockenheim. After its tenure with Kremer in 1975 the car was sold to privateer Heribert Asselborn who went on to race the car for the majority of the 1976 season. At the end of the season 0050004 was sold to racer Georg Feiberger. He finished off 1976 in the car and then sold it to fellow racer Karl-Josef Römer. After this time the car went on to compete in the amateur ranks and until it was rediscovered in 2002 and entered into a comprehensive restoration in Munich, Germany.
<br>
From 2003 to 2004 the car underwent a complete ground-up mechanical and cosmetic restoration in preparation for the 2004 Le Mans Classic. The car was dissembled down to the tub, inspected and re-painted in the proper Wallys Jeans Blue by Freisinger Motorsport. All suspension components were crack checked and restored prior to refitting to the chassis. The original, numbers matching 3.0 liter engine and transmission were rebuilt both mechanically and cosmetically. The mechanical work and reassembly was done by Roitmayer in Munich, Germany. The car was ready in time for the Le Mans Classic in 2004, and then raced again in 2006. It also saw action in an Italian street rally and at Spa.
<br>
In 2008 the car came to the United States, and its new owner enjoyed the car at a number of historic events including the Rennsport Reunion IV, and numerous showings at the Rolex Monterey Motorsport Reunion. 0050004 is totally race ready, this car needs nothing. Not only does the car have both the FIA Historic Vehicle Identity papers and Historic Technical Passport it also still has the original ONS Wagenpass (log book) dating from 1975.
