</head>
Introduced in 1974, the Carrera RS 3.0 is probably the ultimate dual purpose road/racing car. Amongst the rarest of all the 911 derivatives, it was built to replace the ultra-successful 2.7 RS and 2.8 RSR from the previous year of which 1580 cars had been built. Because the new 3.0 RS was judged to be an evolution of the 2.7 RS, the FIA regulated that only a minimum of 100 examples of the new car needed to be built for homologation in either the Group 3 or Group 4 racing classes. A total of 109 Carrera RS 3.0 models were built for 1974 and of those, 52 were RS models to Group 3 spec with the remaining 55 examples built to RSR Group 4 spec. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 2.8 RSR with the brake system from the 917 and was effectively an evolution of the Penske built RS 3.0 cars built for the ’74 IROC series. The use of thinner metal panels and a spartan interior enabled the weight of the new 3.0 RS to be reduced to somewhere around 900 kg.

...In the year 1974, Porsche produced a total of 109 Carrera 3.0. From the total number of units produced, only 54 cars were built to 'RS' specification while the remaining 55 where finished as 'RSR' race cars. The chassis numbers started with

<br>
History > This 1974 3.0L Carrera RSR was ordered by Peter Gregg from Porsche's racing development group at Weissach. It was one of the last RSR Carreras ever completed by the factory. Between 1976 and 1979 this specially-built Weissach 3.0L RSR driven by Jim Busby and Dave Cowart amassed seventeen IMSA podium finishes including eight overall and class wins and the 1978 IMSA GTO Championship. Additionally, it had twenty other top-ten finishes captured at every major road racing venue and endurance event within North America.
<br>
911 560 9114 was delivered with the culmination of experience that both the Weissach racing engineers and the Brumos Racing Team had acquired over the past two and a half years since Gregg had first raced a Porsche RSR. This special Carrera is documented in Karl Ludwigsen's book, "Excellence Was Expected" and is one of the few "customer" Carreras to be so featured. In that narrative Peter Gregg describes 9114 as "definitely the lightest and best-handling Carrera we ever had".
<br>
911 560 9114 was built by the Zuffenhausen customer services department for Peter Gregg and at his request. It was constructed using special 934 pre-production components such as rear trailing suspension arms made of aluminum, extra-thin body panels (for lightness), a 934 style fuel cell, a front-mounted oil tank, plus a one-off fabricated titanium spool for the 915 transaxle. Once completed, 9114 was delivered to Peter Gregg at Brumos Racing in October of 1974.
<br>
For it's very first race, the Daytona Finale in November of 1975, Gregg had Carl Schafer, the "big block" Camaro specialist, drive the car and it finished in eleventh place.
<br>
For 1976, Peter Gregg drove the Brumos-entered BMW CSL's but hedged his team's bets by having Jim Busby drive 9114 on a bonus scheme whereby Busby was rewarded with prize money the higher he placed in the races. Busby did very well with 9114, scoring four outright victories in Camel GT events (Ontario, Sears Point, Mid-Ohio, and Laguna Seca), as well as three third and one second place overall finishes. It has been said that Peter Gregg complained that Busby was earning more money than he was that year.
<br>
At the end of 1976, Jim Busby sold 9114 to Charles Mendez, the Sebring 12-Hour race promoter. Mendez raced the car just twice, (Sebring and Road Atlanta), before selling the RSR to his friend Dave Cowart of Tampa, FL. Mendez sold the RSR because he had bought an ex-Dick Barbour Racing Porsche 934 ½ and no longer had a use for 9114.
<br>
Dave Cowart raced 9114 in IMSA events for the next two and a half years, winning the GTO class outright in 1978 and placing fourth in the GTO Championship in 1979. As he was expecting a new BMW M1 for 1980, he sold the now aging RSR to Jim Mullen who raced the Carrera at Sebring and Riverside. It failed to finish at both venues due to engine failure caused by a collapsed main oil feed line which wasn't discovered until years later when the car was dismantled. This saga is documented in the August 1990 issue of Excellence magazine. Jim Mullen replaced the Carrera with a Mazda, ultimately selling 9114 to Bill Currie of Harvard MA in 1981.
<br>
Bill Currie, partnered with Bud Lyons, directed a total restoration on the RSR. This Carrera was only been seen in public twice between the completion of its restoration in 1994 and 2001. It was first displayed at the 1994 Porsche Parade in Lake Placid, NY. Four years later it was presented with the Brumos Porsche display at the Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance for Porsche's 50th Anniversary celebration. At both events it was exhibited in Brumos Porsche livery bearing a number "59" placard, not the correct number "61" as it was raced by Jim Busby under Brumos/Mitcom sponsorship in 1976. Jim Busby was reunited with his RSR in July of 2001 when he piloted 9114 during the Porsche Rennsport Reuion at Limerock Park. This distinctive RSR is currently owned by Lee Giannone and is participating in vintage racing exhibitions and concours events.

        <p>1975 Carrera 3.0 RSR > This important Porsche racing car was sold new to Jim Busby by Vasek Polak Racing and comes with documentation from Porsche confirming that it is a factory built 1975 3.0 RSR racer. 
<br>
Since its inception, the Porsche 911 has been modified by the factory for various forms of competition including endurance racing, rallying and sprint races. The 911 is often cited as the most successful competition car ever, and in the mid-1970s the normally aspirated Carrera RSR dominated its class in World Championship sports car racing, winning at the Targa Florio, Daytona 24 Hours, Sebring 12 Hours and Nürburgring 1,000kms. 
<br>
Based on the lightweight 911 Carrera RS announced the previous year, Porsche’s RSR GT-category racer collected overall wins in the World Sportscar Championship at Daytona and the Targa Florio in 1973, defeating 3.0-Liter prototypes from Ferrari, Matra and Mirage-Ford in the process, an outstanding achievement for a production-based motor car. Powered initially by a 2.8-Liter, 300bhp engine (later versions used a 3.0-Liter 330bhp unit) the 911 RSR ruled the GT class for which it had been designed to such an extent that the category rapidly became a Porsche benefit. 
<br>
Porsche’s policy had been to entrust defence of their GT division honors to private owners and the Carrera 2.7 had been developed for this purpose. Although the factory also entered some examples, they usually ran in the Prototype class to avoid direct competition with the Zuffenhausen company’s own customers. In similar fashion to the 2.7-Liter Carrera RS, the replacement 2.8/3.0-Liter RS and RSR models were lightened by the use of thin-gauge steel in the body/chassis unit, Spartan furnishing and some plastic components, keeping weight down to around 1,980lb (900kg). The RS was essentially the road-going version, the RSR the racer, and while 109 Carrera RS 3.0s were sold at a price new of DM64,980 each, approximately 57 of them were further modified and prepared for racing or rallying at a further cost of DM30,000. Most were completed in time for the 1974 season, although a few were built for 1975, including ‘9122’, which is the second to last RSR made.
<br>
The RSR conversion differed little from that already applied to the RS, with Delrin bushes instead of rubber providing more precise suspension control; centre-lock 917-pattern magnesium-alloy wheels; a lower nose achieved by different front suspension struts with higher stub axles; and wider front brake calipers accepting thicker pads for endurance racing.
<br>
The ‘standard’ engine had bore and stroke dimensions of 95x70.4mm, displacing 2,992cc, and with a compression ratio of 9.8:1 developed circa 230bhp at 6,200rpm. The RSR Type 911/95 engine, however, developed fully 100bhp more, some 330 overall plus 233lb/ft torque at 6,500rpm. Cylinder heads, cylinder barrels and pistons were aluminium, and the RSR also featured twin-plug ignition, polished ports, Bosch fuel injection and cam profiles matching those of the old Carrera 6 model.
<br>
A former drag racer from Laguna Beach, California, Jim Busby used chassis number ‘911 560 9122’ throughout the 1975 season with considerable success. At the end of the 1976 the car was sold to Monte Shelton, who acid-dipped the bodyshell, modified the roll cage and installed superior Schrick camshafts, bringing the horsepower output to 365bhp and reducing the weight to 2,000lbs (909kg). Shelton then sold the car to privateer competitor Robert Frostrom, of Salisbury, Mayland, who continued to race it in professional events throughout the 1978 season. Frostrom sold the Carrera onward to Bill Ferran who used it in Sports Car Club of America national level events in 1979, winning twice at Moroso from the pole position. In 1980 and 1981, wearing 935-style bodywork, the RSR again saw competition at international level when it was campaigned at the famed 12 Hours of Sebring by Ferran/Bond/Refenning, finishing 10th in class in the 1980 event. 
<br>
Re-bodied to RSR specification, ‘9122’ was next sold to Ray Stuart in Monterey, subsequently passing through the hands of Kerry Morse (1985), Louis Bernat (1986), David Mohlman (2000) and Phil Bagley before being acquired by the current vendor. The car has recently undergone a comprehensive restoration returning it to original RSR specification and since completion has enjoyed successful outings in vintage racing at the Monterey Historic Automobile Races in 2006, 2007 and 2008 among various other events. The car has approximately ten events on the chassis since restoration; zero time on a fresh valve job; approximately six hours on the engine bottom-end (rebuilt by David Loop in Monterey, California); and equal time on a rebuilt transmission. 
<br>
Other recent work includes a complete professional chassis set-up with new rear shocks/springs, front springs and new rear sway bar. New steering shaft bushings and bearings have been installed; the distributor rebuilt with a new ignition rotor; the front strut cartridges rebuilt; new steering rods and links installed; rear trailing arm (front) pivot bearings replaced; and the CV joints serviced.
<br>
The talented team at D’Motorsports of Monterey, California have serviced and race-prepared the car in a no-expense-spared fashion throughout the current ownership period, and today ‘9122’ can be described as a very well prepared and maintained RSR with excellent racing cosmetics, fit to be raced or shown. The accompanying history file contains assorted period photographs and previous-owner correspondence, sundry parts invoices and restoration photographs, while included in the sale is a extensive spares package. For a complete listing, interested parties should contact the Bonhams office for further assistance. Offered on a Bill of Sale.

        <p>1975 Porsche Carrera RSR Kremer > This is the Wallys Jeans sponsored RSR built by Kremer and raced primary by Cees Sievertsen in 1975. It has extensive European racing history and many podium finishes (see history below) including first place finishes at Diepholz and Hockenheim. After its tenure with Kremer in 1975 the car was sold to privateer Heribert Asselborn who went on to race the car for the majority of the 1976 season. At the end of the season 0050004 was sold to racer Georg Feiberger. He finished off 1976 in the car and then sold it to fellow racer Karl-Josef Römer. After this time the car went on to compete in the amateur ranks and until it was rediscovered in 2002 and entered into a comprehensive restoration in Munich, Germany.
<br>
From 2003 to 2004 the car underwent a complete ground-up mechanical and cosmetic restoration in preparation for the 2004 Le Mans Classic. The car was dissembled down to the tub, inspected and re-painted in the proper Wallys Jeans Blue by Freisinger Motorsport. All suspension components were crack checked and restored prior to refitting to the chassis. The original, numbers matching 3.0 liter engine and transmission were rebuilt both mechanically and cosmetically. The mechanical work and reassembly was done by Roitmayer in Munich, Germany. The car was ready in time for the Le Mans Classic in 2004, and then raced again in 2006. It also saw action in an Italian street rally and at Spa.
<br>
In 2008 the car came to the United States, and its new owner enjoyed the car at a number of historic events including the Rennsport Reunion IV, and numerous showings at the Rolex Monterey Motorsport Reunion. 0050004 is totally race ready, this car needs nothing. Not only does the car have both the FIA Historic Vehicle Identity papers and Historic Technical Passport it also still has the original ONS Wagenpass (log book) dating from 1975.
